Here are the inicial instructions to git and github usage
md means markdown which is used to readme files
Hi! This project teaches you how to use git.
git init: initializes an new empty git repository; branch (master) is the one main branch created everytime we create a new repository
git add: send files to staging area, the moment which is previous to commit. At this point you need to specify what file you're adding. Example: git add readme.md
git status: self-explanatory
git commit: actually commits the files on stage to the branch on repository. For that you must name de commit. Example: git commit: -m "first commit".
git branch -M: changes the name of the main branch from Master to Main. Example: git branch -M "main"
git remote add origin: For the next step you shall create a new repository at github website and use the platform instructions to conect both git and github repository
git push -u origin main: send the files at local repository to the remote repository, at this example the files at main branch are being pushed 
clear: clears the previous comands at git to make it cleaner while you're ate continuous use
